# Production Fix - MongoDB URI Format Issue

## Issue Found

The production environment variable `MONGODB_URI` was missing quotes around the connection string, which could cause connection string parsing issues.

## Current Status

- **Local (.env.local)**: Has quotes ✅ - WORKING
- **Production (.env.vercel)**: Was missing quotes ❌ - BROKEN
- **Fixed (.env.vercel)**: Now has quotes ✅ - NEEDS DEPLOYMENT

## Required Action

Update Vercel environment variables to include quotes around MONGODB_URI:

```
MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://knoxvilledan2:AAAWWW333mmm@cluster1.fc7watg.mongodb.net/AmpTrack?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster1"
```

## How to Update Vercel Environment Variables

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/daniel-nelsons-projects/v-one/settings/environment-variables
2. Find MONGODB_URI
3. Edit it to add quotes around the entire connection string
4. Redeploy the application

## Expected Result

This should fix the production database connection issues affecting both admin and public users.
